💰 Loan Default Prediction Model
📝 Project Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan using historical loan and customer data. The goal is to help banks and lending institutions reduce risk, improve lending decisions, and optimize approval processes.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze borrower and loan data to identify risk factors.

Build predictive models to estimate default probability.

Evaluate model performance and interpret key risk features.

Provide insights for smarter lending decisions.

Confusion Matrix

📊 Key Insights

High DTI and low credit score are major predictors of default.

Longer loan terms with high amounts increase default probability.

Ensemble models (XGBoost / Random Forest) outperform logistic regression.

📌 Outcomes

Built a Loan Default Prediction Model with ROC-AUC ≈ 0.75–0.78.

Identified high-risk borrowers for proactive risk management.

Developed dashboards in Tableau for loan performance monitoring.

🚀 Future Work

Deploy the model as a web application (Streamlit / Flask) for real-time risk scoring.

Incorporate additional financial indicators for improved prediction.

Apply Explainable AI techniques (SHAP / LIME) for transparency in lending decisions.
